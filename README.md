Find the number - Oxygen Project

This is the goal: 
  *Find the three-digits number*
  *The digits do not repeat*
  *There is no zero in any digits*
  
These are the rules:
  *You will write a *three digit* number and the program will tell you 
  *if any of your numbers is *fixed-in-place*, *guessed* somewhere in there, or not there at all
  *You can try numbers till you find the original one
  
Example:
  -Let *345* be the number we should find...
  -If I try *123*, the program will tell me I have *1* *guessed* number and *0* 
  -numbers *fixed-in-place*.
  -If I try *398*, the program will tell me I have *0* *guessed* numbers and *1*
  -*fixed-in-place*
  -If I try *678*, the program will tell me I have *0* *guessed* numbers and *0*
  -*fixed-in-place*
  
Note: 
  -Guessed numbers are denoted with the letter *Q*  (Qelluar, alb. lang.)
  -Fixed-in-place numbers are denoted with the letter *F* (Fiksuar, alb. lang.)
